- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevZaks 
- 👀 I’m interested in fast and scalable cloud solutions that are inspired by real life problems (especially the ones we are facing everyday in Africa and Nigeria)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Redux, and Data Analytics (with google) I'm looking forward to learning Go as well (for performance) and python (for Data Analytics)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects that leverage my current skillsets and the new ones I'm learning 
- 📫 How to reach me: twitter @DevZaks or [visit my portfolio Web Site](https://devzaks.netlify.app)
